    <h4><strong>PIAIC</strong></h4>
    <h2><strong>PRESIDENTIAL INITIATIVE FOR ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE<br> AND COMPUTING</strong></h2>
    <p>Presidential Initiative for Artificial Intelligence and Computing (PIAIC) is a privataly funded
        not-<br>for-profit
        educational initiative started by President of Pakistan, Dr. Arif Alvi, Kazi Rahat Ali, and<br>Zia Khan to help
        promote education, research, and business opportunities in emerging tech<br>fields like.

    <h3><strong class="strong">C</strong>loud Native Computing:</h3>
    <p>
        The <strong>Cloud Native Computing</strong> program prepares the students to program in open
        source<br>technologies like,
        <em><strong>Linux, Docker, Kubernetes, JavaScript, Node.js, React and React Native</strong></em><br>
        while introducing the students to the development of Microservices and software development<br>techniques on
        cloud platforms like <em>AWS</em>.
    </p>

    <h3><strong class="strong">A</strong>rtificial Intelligence:</h3>
    <p>
        The <strong>artificial intelligence</strong> program of PIAIC takes the student through the foundation of the
        AI<br>
        technology, via teaching programming in open source languages like <em> <strong> Python, Numpy, Pandas,<br>
                Tensorflow 2.0 and Flask,</strong></em>
        and teaching deploying practical AI solutions and use cases, and<br>ending with real-life examples of modern day
        AI in practice.
    </p>

    <h3><strong class="strong">B</strong>lockchain:</h3>
    <p>
        The main emphasis of <strong>Blockchain</strong> program is to understand the blockchains like
        <em><strong>Ethereum<br> and Hyperledger (Fabric),</strong></em> and learn to program in languages such as
        Solidity,JavaScript on<br>
        frameworks like Node.js. The program also introduces them to development of Distributed Apps <br> (DApps),
        frameworks like Web3 and Truffle and an in-depth understanding of Blockchain-as-a- <br>service (BaaS) and how to
        develop
        and offer an Initial Coin Offering (ICO) of a crypto-token.
    </p>

    <h3><strong class="strong">I</strong>nternet of Things:</h3>
    <p>
        The <strong>Internet of things</strong> program introduces the students to open source development<br>
        technologies like <em><strong>Rust, Embedded Rust, WebAssembly, Hyper, Diesel, Google Assistant,<br>
                and Kubernetes</strong></em> while making them efficient in developing Micro Services for IoT Edge,
        IoT<br>
        Cloud, and voice computing for device control.
